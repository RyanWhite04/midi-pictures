# midi-pictures
Pictures of the 128 standard instruments on MIDI piano keyboards, with CC licensing from Wikimedia Commons.
Useful for programs that implement MIDI instruments, such as MIDI.js, and want a sample picture of each one.
Images significantly larger than 2000x2000px have been reduced from the original file. The address of the original file is given in the tab-delimited file index.txt.
